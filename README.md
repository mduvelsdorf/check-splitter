Tip Calculator and Check Splitter

This application is designed to take user input to determine tip and the total amount to pay. In addition, the check can be split evenly when provided the number of guests or will divide the check by items ordered.

By downloading all files, this application can be run locally through a preferred Internet Browser.

The first 3 fields are required and take in user input through jQuery. The user can then determine how the tool should calculate the bill. The "Calculate" button simply runs a tip calculator function that will output the tip to the inner HTML. The "Split Evenly" button will ask for user input to determine the number of guests to split the bill and calculate how much each person owes. The "Split by Item" button will again ask for user input to determine the number of guests. From there, the user will add each menu item on the receipt, marking which guest ordered each item with a dynamic drop-down menu. The "Calculate Split" button will use arrays to match and store guest totals. The output for both the Split Evenly and Split by Item features will include both a breakdown of how much each guest owes and links to common online payment services. In addition, the Split by Item feature includes a tooltip for each guest that breaks down each menu item ordered and how much is being paid in tax and tip and a piechart (Google Charts) which visually displays the guest total breakdowns.
